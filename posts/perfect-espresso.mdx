## Ingredients and Equipment:

- Freshly roasted coffee beans
- Burr grinder
- Espresso machine
- Scale
- Tamper
- Filter basket
- Clean, filtered water

## Steps:

### 1. Choose High-Quality Coffee Beans:

The perfect espresso start with coffee beans. You can create et good espresso with a medium machine but you cannot with no speciality coffee beans. Try to find your coffee perfect for you a try to talk with a professional to guide you to chocolate, floral… depend on your taste. The coffee beans need to be freshly roasted. Coffee beans over time oxidize. try to put them in pressurized bocal and not in the sun. If you don’t know if the coffee beans are still in good condition, after your extraction there should be a layer if crema. If  the is not, it’s not serious don’t worry you can still use it but the crema add texture and a bit of amertume that enhance the taste of your shot.

### 2. Choose a good Water:

The water is important. Try to use none calcareous water for the health of your machine and your taste. Also try to favor a poorly mineralized water. It affect the coffee, More precisely the acidity and a bitter aftertaste.

### 3. Measure the Coffee:

The measurement of your beans for a shot is really important. Yes a gram can change but not to obviously. Use a Precise scale to help you. On average, 18g is a good shot you can go less you can go for more but we need to keep in mind that we need to extract according with the grams of beans. This is a Standard, the espresso is a lot of test and try for you to create your own recipe and enjoy your coffee.

### 3. Grind the Coffee:

Grind a coffee is one of the more important part of making the perfect shot. Indeed you need to find the right coffee grind for the water go threw not to fast, but not to slow either. For this part you need to do test with your own coffee brewer but try to talk with people that sell you the coffee, the can guide you. Try not to brew coffee lot of time before using it because oxidizes more easily grind. The better way is just before doing it.

### 4. Preheat the Espresso Machine:

Preheat your coffee machine have two assets. The first one is to eject water that was stuck and not really hot pipes. The second one heat the pipes to keep more longer the good temperature. The standard water temperature is around 93ºC - 199ºF. 

### 5. Prepare the Portafilter:

Fore a good shot, some conditions has to be done before tamp the coffee. The first one is if you have some coffee blocks, you need to breaks them to only have fine grind. the second step is to distribute evenly because if you tamp your coffee and there is more in one side, the water will go in the simplest side. that is why your the distribution of your coffee must be equal. There is tool to help you to do it like a WDT tool to break the blocks or a coffee distributor….

### 6. Tamp the Coffee:

Tamp a coffee is a precise a more muscular movement. Likely to not be complicated, some tamper have a spring to always tamp as the same pressure because tamp to much is not good and not tamp enough is not good either because of the water will pass through too fast or not passe at all. it’s more complicated to tamp too much counter to not tamp enough. The good tamp is like 10-13kg / 15-30lbs. The most important in this part is to be horizontal. the same as before, if the we tamp more in one side, the water will go through the most simple way.  Try to hold the portafilter horizontally and tamp as the same. if it’s a simple tamper, try to guide you with your finger to see if your tamping to much in one side or not. It’s all good, Insert your portafilter securely.

### 8. Start the Extraction:

The extraction is like a recipe, if you have 18g of coffee, the most used recipe is 40g of coffee at the end for 25-30sec of extraction. The  time start a the first drop of coffee touch the cup. Too help you in all tasks, you must have a precise scale. If the coffee is going to fast, it’s most of the time the grind. Too coarse. if Is too slow instead it’s  too fine. It can be also the tamp but try to tamp as the same pressure and keep it. Thing that need to change is the grind of coffee.

### 9. Observe the Crema:

Observe your espresso, if there is no crema, it can be two things, the oxidation or the grind. It’s often sign of a good extraction. Keep in mind that special espresso do not deliver much or not crema. It not always true. The crema need to be thick and consistant and have golden-brown color. If the crema is pale, the coffee is a bit old or the coffee is not really a coffee that deliver crema.

### 10. Adjust as Needed:

Taste it. What do you think. There is a thing you need to know. If you want a coffee who leaves more on the bitter, grind a bit more the coffee fore the coffee extract in 35sec. If contrary you want it a bit more acidic, try to grind just a bit more fine to bo in 20sec but “the Golden Shot” is about 25-30sec of extraction,  for 40g in the cup,  and 18g of coffee beans. It should be rich, powerful, full-bodied and have a balanced flavor profile.

### 11. Clean the Equipment:

The cleaning must be taken seriously. For you, your experience and for your equipment. To not get dirty, clean your portafilter, filter with water and if you have a machine with backflush option, do it daily. if you haven’t try to replace the water with vinegar and run the machine few times.

That’s it. You hold all the card to make the perfect shot of espresso. It’s a repetitive process and the result of your own experience.
